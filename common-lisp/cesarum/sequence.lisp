(defgeneric replace-subseq (insert sequence start &optional end)

  ;; Note: we could add a filler parameter and not adjust the size
  ;;       when reduced, but this would make a different behavior than
  ;;       when increasing the size.  Would still be nice for some
  ;;       applications.  Perhaps also a truncatep parameter?

  ;; BUG:  we should use the fill-pointer before trying to adjust.

  (:documentation "

DO:             Destructively (if possible) replace the (subseq
                sequence start end) with the elements from INSERT.  If
                START and END don't specify a strict subseq of
                SEQUENCE then an error is signaled.

INSERT:         A sequence.

SEQUENCE:       A sequence.   If it is a list or an adjustable vector,
                or if the subseq is of same length as INSERT then it
                will be destructively modified and returned.
                Otherwise a fresh adjustable vector will be returned.

START:          Bounding index designator of SEQUENCE.

END:            Bounding index designator of SEQUENCE. The default for
                end is NIL, which means (LENGTH SEQUENCE).

RETURN:         Either the modified SEQUENCE, or a fresh sequence of
                the same type with the specified subseq replaced by
                elements from INSERT.

PREDICATE:      A predicate on elements of the SEQUENCE sequence.  When
                returning true, the sequence is split before and after
                the element, which are removed from the resulting
                subsequences.

SEQUENCE:       A sequence.

REMOVE-EMPTY-SUBSEQS:
                A boolean.  If true, empty subsequences are removed from the result.

RETURN:         A list of subsequences of SEQUENCE, split upon any
                element for which the PREDICATE is true.

EXAMPLES:       (split-sequence-if (function zerop) '(1 2 0 3 4 5 0 6 7 8 0 9))
